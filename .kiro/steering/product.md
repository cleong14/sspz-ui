# SSP Generation Application - Product Context

## Application Purpose

**sspz-ui** generates System Security Plans (SSPs) for government compliance with automated NIST control mapping and multi-format exports.

**Core User Flow**: System Details → Tool Selection → Control Mapping → SSP Generation → Export (HTML/PDF/CSV/JSON)

## Domain Knowledge

### SSP Generation Process

1. **System Configuration** - User inputs system details, environment, and security requirements
2. **Tool Selection** - Choose security tools and technologies used in the system
3. **Control Mapping** - Automatically map NIST controls to selected tools and configurations
4. **SSP Generation** - Generate comprehensive security plan document
5. **Export Options** - Output in multiple formats (HTML, PDF, CSV, JSON)

### Key Business Rules

- **NIST Compliance**: All control mappings must be accurate and up-to-date
- **Government Standards**: Follow federal security documentation requirements
- **Multi-Format Support**: Export capability for various stakeholder needs
- **Validation Required**: All user inputs must be validated before SSP generation
- **Audit Trail**: Maintain history of SSP generations and modifications

### Critical Data Sources

- **Control Catalogs**: Static JSON files in `public/control-catalogs/`
  - NIST 800-53 controls
  - Other government frameworks
- **System Configurations**: User-defined system parameters
- **Tool Mappings**: Security tool to control relationships
- **Implementation Guidance**: Control implementation templates

## User Experience Priorities

### Primary Users

- **Security Engineers** - Creating and maintaining SSPs
- **Compliance Officers** - Reviewing and approving security documentation
- **System Administrators** - Providing technical system details

### Key User Needs

- **Efficiency**: Reduce manual SSP creation time from weeks to hours
- **Accuracy**: Ensure NIST control mappings are correct and complete
- **Flexibility**: Support various system types and security tools
- **Collaboration**: Enable team review and approval workflows
- **Compliance**: Meet all government documentation standards

### Critical User Journeys

1. **New SSP Creation** - First-time system documentation
2. **SSP Updates** - Modifying existing plans for system changes
3. **Compliance Review** - Validating SSP against current requirements
4. **Export & Sharing** - Distributing SSPs to stakeholders

## Technical Constraints

### Performance Requirements

- **Large Data Sets**: Control catalogs contain thousands of controls
- **Real-time Validation**: Form validation must be immediate
- **Export Performance**: Large document generation must be optimized
- **Responsive UI**: Support for various screen sizes and devices

### Security Requirements

- **Authentication**: AWS Cognito for all user access
- **Data Sanitization**: All user inputs must be sanitized
- **File Validation**: Strict validation of uploads and downloads
- **NIST Compliance**: Follow government security standards

### Integration Points

- **AWS Services**: Cognito for auth, potential S3 for document storage
- **Control Frameworks**: Static JSON integration with NIST catalogs
- **Export Systems**: PDF generation, HTML rendering, CSV/JSON export

## Success Metrics

### User Success

- Time to complete SSP generation (target: <2 hours)
- Control mapping accuracy (target: >95%)
- User satisfaction with generated documentation
- Reduction in manual review time

### Technical Success

- Application performance (page load <3 seconds)
- Export generation time (large SSPs <30 seconds)
- Test coverage (>80% for core SSP functionality)
- Zero critical security vulnerabilities
